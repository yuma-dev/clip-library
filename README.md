# Clip Library
![Title Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02786eb6-dfb9-4861-a34a-2bad112b5333)
Clip Library is a versatile desktop application designed to manage and enhance your video clip collection. Built to complement OBS Studio and other video capture tools, it offers a user-friendly interface for organizing, editing, and exporting your clips.


## Reasoning

Clip Library was born out of a need for a comprehensive clip management solution that bridges the gap between powerful recording software like OBS Studio and user-friendly clip management tools. While OBS Studio excels at capturing high-quality clips, it lacks built-in features for easy trimming, organizing, and exporting. On the other hand, solutions like Steelseries GG Moments, while user-friendly, have limitations such as:

 - Lack of support for videos not made by their own software
 - Lack of automatic consistent desktop capture
 - Limited support for large clip libraries
 - Intrusive watermarks 

**Clip Library aims to provide the best of both worlds:**

1. Use OBS Studio (or other preferred software) for high-quality clip capture
2. Use Clip Library for efficient management, editing, and exporting of your clips

This project allows content creators, gamers, and video enthusiasts to leverage the power of professional capture tools while enjoying streamlined clip management.

_(the last export saved the video into my clipboard instead of saving as a file, for easy sharing)_

### 🔊 Persistent Clip Settings
Adjust and save settings for individual clips, including volume, name, and playback speed. These settings are saved for each specific clip, so the next time you open that clip, it will have the same customized settings.

### 🔄 Reversable Edits
All edits are non-destructive and fully reversible.
Clip Library saves edit information separately, preserving your original video files.

`Exluding Deletion, this will permanently Delete the actual Video file!`

### 🩺 Diagnostics Bundle
