# Clip Library
![Title Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26aac2d1-d5a8-442d-9831-29941401de52)
Clip Library is a versatile desktop application designed to manage and enhance your video clip collection. Built to complement OBS Studio and other video capture tools, it offers a user-friendly interface for organizing, editing, and exporting your clips.

## Reasoning

Clip Library was born out of a need for a comprehensive clip management solution that bridges the gap between powerful recording software like OBS Studio and user-friendly clip management tools. While OBS Studio excels at capturing high-quality clips, it lacks built-in features for easy trimming, organizing, and exporting. On the other hand, solutions like Steelseries GG Moments, while user-friendly, have limitations such as:

 - Lack of support for videos not made by their own software
 - Lack of automatic consistent desktop capture
 - Limited support for large clip libraries
 - Intrusive watermarks 




**Clip Library aims to provide the best of both worlds:**

1. Use OBS Studio (or other preferred software) for high-quality clip capture
2. Use Clip Library for efficient management, editing, and exporting of your clips

This project allows content creators, gamers, and video enthusiasts to leverage the power of professional capture tools while enjoying streamlined clip management.

## Disclaimer: AI-Assisted Development

Clip Library has been developed with the heavy assistance of AI technologies. 
While this approach has allowed for rapid development and implementation of complex features, it may result in code that is occasionally inconsistent or could be optimized further.
I acknowledge that this method is not ideal for production software, but it has enabled me to quickly create a functional tool that addresses a real need.
I am committed to ongoing improvements and optimizations.
Contributions from the community to enhance code quality, performance, and features are always welcome.
